# Introduction
Individuals across the globe are urged to slow the spread of COVID-19.  Governments are implementing everything from mild **shelter in place** to extreme [*shoot them dead*](https://www.voanews.com/science-health/coronavirus-outbreak/philippine-president-says-those-violating-anti-virus-measures) measures to control this global crisis.

All these efforts are in hopes of flattening the curve.  According to this [article]((https://www.biospace.com/article/flattening-the-curve-covid-19/)), high peaks put a lot of pressure on health care systems which they struggle to respond to.

So what does this curve look like for my state of Virginia?  I've seen a rising curve for the entire United States, but I've only seen the current number of cases for a particular day.  I don't know how this number compares to last week.

[World O Meter](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) and [Bing's Coronoavirus updates](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Coronavirus+updates) provide nice summaries, but neither of these web sites showed the trend of confirmed cases over time.

All I needed was the data.  After countless searches, I stumbled upon the University of Virginia's [COVID-19 Surveillance Dashboard](https://nssac.bii.virginia.edu/covid-19/dashboard/).  It is a nice real-time dashboard that also allows one to download data.  Upon inspection of the provided datasets, I found what I was looking for.  

This personal project is my attempt to understand the COVID-19 curve and how the number of cases affects the shape of the curve.
